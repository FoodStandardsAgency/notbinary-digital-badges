Gaps from this discovery.

### Consumer research
Impact on consumers and how they will use and understand the badges was covered in the previous phase 1 work. Customer needs can be found [here](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-digital-badges/wiki/Previous-research,-phase-1-discovery).

### Local authority research
Impact on LAs was considered and captured in our future service map, and with the recommendation to review the FHRS inspection process, we had the opportunity to some light polling with LAs. 

### Smaller business research
Due to timelines, engagement with smaller businesses was a challenge. We have created a survey including stimuli relating to design and on-boarding which will continue to be circulated beyond the end date of this project. Additionally businesses we spoke to represented owner/operators and expressed many of their challenges.
