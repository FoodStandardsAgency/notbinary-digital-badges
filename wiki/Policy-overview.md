The policies that govern the service are all in place to maintain the safety and standards around food, ensure it is safe to eat, and it is what it says it is. The agency publish extensive [business guidance](https://www.food.gov.uk/business-guidance) that covers the full breadth of legislation that needs to be covered.

The FSA does have remit in in England and Wales, by district and London borough councils, the Common Council of the City of London and the Council of the Isles of Scilly.

The FSA does not have remit and is no longer represented in Scotland, which has its own organisation: [Food Standards Scotland](https://www.foodstandards.gov.scot/).

The FSA is the Competent Authority for food & feed safety for the EU/legislation and they negotiate on behalf of devolved colleagues but, generally, do not enforce the legislation.

The FSA is responsible for implementing EU legislation into UK law but delegates the power of enforcement of legislation to Local Authorities, who do so on the agencies behalf. The exception being meat hygiene in meat plants.
