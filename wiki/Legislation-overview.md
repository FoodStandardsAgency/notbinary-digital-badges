Most of food law is owned by the Policy teams within the FSA or other government departments (OGDs).

The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme scores are derived from the Food Law Code of Practices, these give instructions that local authorities must consider when enforcing food law. Local authorities need to follow and implement the relevant sections of the Code that apply.

## Freedom of information 

Information collected as part of the food safety officerâ€™s inspection report requested under [Freedom of Information Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/contents). FOI requests are made to the local authority that carried out the inspection, and not the FSA.
