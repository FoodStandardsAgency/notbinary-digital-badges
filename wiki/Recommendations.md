The future service described in the map describes how a fully integrated and mandated service would work. It has been created to set a vision, where all necessary changes to the existing service have been implemented. However, realistically this will not all happen at once, so we have broken down our recommendations to reflect what could be done now and where to focus efforts for the future.

## Now
* Campaign to drive awareness of FHRS service which is already available
* Create a suite of badges that are attractive to use and with guidelines of how to use them - encourage use rather than enforce

## Soon
* Spend effort on cleaning up data, syncing database with MIS and improving search
* Speed up inspection processes - digital by default (for example, email out ratings, do inspections digitally, allow for better fast track ratings publication). Increased provision of EHOs and more consistency in governance around timings, costs and prioritisation.
* If mandating display - make a minimum requirement of a URL link initially for small businesses, but encourage display of badge
* Consider segmenting businesses - focus on large food groups, large franchises and aggregators first


## Later
* Align and integrate Register A Food Business with Food Hygiene Rating Scheme to ensure data is up to date and reflective of the changing food industry
* Create UIDs to track and manage data
