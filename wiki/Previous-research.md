## Customer needs

Phase 2 has focused on business needs and the support required to implement FHRS digital badges. 

Previous research had focused on customers. We have summarised user needs and pain points below from the following reports: 

* Fluxx Discovery report - This covered Business and Consumer research, personas, high level journeys, digital badge designs and user testing feedback.
* Fluxx User personas - consumer personas
* Fluxx User Journeys - consumers and small business owners
* Fluxx Rapid Landscaping - detailing the range of different applications and platforms businesses could use to build their websites.
* Just Eat - ratings go digital user research report. This included findings from A/B testing, interviews and user testing covering user attitudes, understanding and response to digital badges, placement and design, both in qualitative feedback and impact on ordering.
*  TNS BMRB Research: Food Standards Agency - Understanding Northern Ireland consumer needs around Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) information in online retail environments
FHRS Online Display in Wales Research report October 2019 - This report focused on consumer expectations and insights to inform placement of badges
* All previous design files
* API documentation

### Needs
* Would like consistency of information available about ratings both online and in a physical environment - if it is mandatory offline it should also be so online
* Only want to order from 3 and above (would pass/fail be and easier distinction?)
* Need to understand where the rating has come from and it's 'quality' - The process and rating of food businesses is not clear or widely understood. Is it trustworthy? Does it meet my standard?
* Would like to be able to filter choices by FHRS rating
* Don't want to have to worry about hygiene with trusted brands/supermarkets
* Dual language/Welsh/English versions is important in Wales

### Pain points: 
* Context and awareness isn't high enough. Although the stickers are highly recognised, most customers were not clear on their meaning. Is a 3 good or bad? What is the score out of? 
* There are lots of factors and data available to consider when making decisions online (peer reviews, other rating systems, delivery time, dietary needs etc) with varying sources and quality - it can be hard to trust or put the right value on each of these
* The FSA logo can conjure up negative imagery when ordering food - making people think about dirty kitchens
* With the lack of visual cues or information on food hygiene or quality, people rely on user reviews and other visual information. Google street view also gets used at a way to determine the standard of the establishment
* Restaurants or food businesses that donâ€™t display their food rating raise questions about their hygiene standards? What are you ashamed of?
* How can they trust that businesses are displaying the correct rating?
