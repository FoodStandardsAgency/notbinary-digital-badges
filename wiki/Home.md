***


This wiki contains documentation describing the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) Digital Badges Service. It is intended to be a place where the squad (team) can keep track of progress and document their findings from the discovery, and extend into the full lifecycle of the service if it progresses to Alpha (and beyond). It is also intended to be a 'homepage' where the squad can signpost to data and information that exists elsewhere.

Phase 2 discovery focuses on testing the service design (prototyping) and building detail for progress to Alpha. Ensuring to cover both functional, non-functional and data-level needs, as well as, any key assumptions / dependencies to test out in Alpha.

These will include:

- **Design**: Recommendations for final suite of badges which are **compliant** with appropriate requirements and available for businesses to use
- **Policy**: Findings and recommendations to inform the **development of policies** regarding mandatory requirements for FHRS on-line display. 
- **Technology and data**: Identification of **technical requirements** including API integration and how badges are kept current (such as a technical model and high-level requirements in the form of epic user stories)
- **Implementation**: Identification of service requirements for implementation such as **technical support and guidance** for businesses implementing digital badges.  

## Service overview

The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) helps consumers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving them clear information about the businessesâ€™ hygiene standards.

## Policy & legislation

The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme scores are derived from the Food Law Code of Practices, these give instructions that local authorities must consider when enforcing food law. Local authorities need to follow and implement the relevant sections of the Code that apply.

The policies that govern the service are all in place to maintain the safety and standards around food, ensure it is safe to eat, and it is what it says it is.

## User needs

The process needs to be simple and easy. Digital skills likely to be varied, and not necessarily a priority

## Digital badge designs

The learning curve of consumers will change over time, some learnings could be taken from other policy implementation over recent past such as cookie law, GDPR or The Modern Slavery Act. As a research group, we found that awareness is key for both businesses and consumers and any decision for digital display must be accompanied by a through-the-line campaign for awareness over a structured period of time.

## Technology and data

Technology and data needs for FHRS digital badges are focused around legacy database migration and reconciliation, new business registration, UID, assets delivery, governance and automation.

## Recommendations

Our recommendations focus on the need to clean the FHRS data, review and look for efficiencies in the FHRS inspection process, as well as prototype and test a suite of badges that are attractive to use and with guidelines of how to use them.
