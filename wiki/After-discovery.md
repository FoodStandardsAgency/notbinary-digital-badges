## What happens next?
The next phase is Prototyping, where we try out different solutions to the problems we learnt about during the Discovery.

This means:

* Building prototypes
* Testing different ideas
* Challenging the way things are done
* Exploring new approaches

This activity can inform the priorities for an extended alpha development phase, which typically runs over 8-10 weeks, and is more collaborative and hands-on than Discovery.  

## Who's involved?

* Core team (including analysis, design and development): day-to-day delivery
* FHRS policy team members: for testing, feedback and continued input
* Local authority Environmental Health Officers users: testing, feedback and validation
* Business users: testing, feedback and validation
* DDAT community: additional challenge, support and potential wider FSA sharing
* Other FSA discovery teams: shared learning, best practice

## Alpha - areas to focus on
During this project, we have recommended a number of initiatives which would need to be explored, prototyped and tested during and Alpha stage. The next steps we would recommend are:
* User testing of new badge designs across a range of websites and devices - with consumers
* User test on-boarding process for business users
* Prototype tech solution - focusing on the badge 'selector' for users, where they choose which design they want, and can access the code. Also need to test creation of unique and trackable badges, and explore authenticity solutions such as 2 factor authentication.
* Review database and those of Local Authorities to understand and size the remodelling. Come up with a consistent data model with fixed and well governed fields
* Work with local authorities to co-design solutions to time-lags, such as how they prioritise inspections and the rollout of digital Proforma for inspections
* Draft legislation and work with BA to understand the impact based on different policy decisions (e.g. language around placement - for example 'at point of choice' vs 'on your website')
