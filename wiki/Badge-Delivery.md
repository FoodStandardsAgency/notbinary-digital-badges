## Onboarding


_Challenges:_
* Too many platforms and technical structures to find one solution for
* Business' capability for digital implementation
* Business' time and resource for digital implementation
* Bugs and patching updates
* Backlash if support is not reasonable

_Recommendations:_
* Visual and video based step-by-step guides for how to choose and implement badges based on what type of platform you manage
* A community forum for questions where businesses can help one another
* A community manager to manage requests, answer questions and respond to any negative comments
* A technical help desk to raise tickets for bugs or update requests
* A help line / live chat to speak to support teams
* Nationwide digital clinics, where businesses can visit support teams in their town and better understand how to display their badges


## Getting a badge

_Challenges:_
* Authenticity: how do consumers know the business is using the right rating and not someone else's?
* Authenticity: How do aggregators access lots of badges without 'stealing'?
* Data error: what happens when a business' badge doesn't work?
* Accessing large sets of badges for chains, aggregators and groups
* Business managers not understanding the onboarding and access process
* Choosing a badge that works best for your platform or business type

_Recommendations:_
* Give the businesses the option to select which kind of asset they want to use
* Taking inspiration from asset serving platforms such as Giphy, offer an array of links for each design type - including static download
* Keep the open data on FHRS website, but potentially add a layer of security for accessing embed codes for digital badges (such as 2FA but not compulsory)
* Allow for larger businesses to export multiple registered business' badges at once
* Require a dedicated digital manager and fallback contact for each business, who can verify any incorrect data or badges
* Give businesses a preview tool, so they may see how the badges look on their platform when selecting a design type
  * Enter a business URL
  * Choose a design
  * Choose a placement 
  * See preview of badge
  * Export screengrab of preview for implementation help or support
