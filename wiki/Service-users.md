End users fall into two broad groups, businesses and consumers. However there are a wide range of different business to consider:

For this project were asked to consider all types of food business which included 

* Restaurant/Café/Canteen, 
* Hotel/Guest House, 
* Small Retailer, 
* Supermarket/Hypermarket,
* Caring Premises, 
* Restaurant and Caterers - Other, 
* Distributors/Transporters, 
* Pub/Club, Retailer – Other, 
* Take-Away, 
* School/College, 
* Mobile Food Unit, 
* Manufacturers and Packers, 
* Importers/Exporters,
* Primary Producers

We focused initially on:
* Hospitality – so restaurants, hotels, takeaways
* Aggregators – Just Eat etc but also Trivago, Book a table etc
* Business to business – Manufacturers/Processors/Distributors/Transporters

**However** the food business industry is incredibly diverse, and in this context the structure and operating models of the organisation had more impact on how they would engage and use the service.

We have identified the following operating models (there are doubt other operating models we've not yet identified):
* Owner/operator (single owner run businesses)
* Chain - multiple sites for a single brand
* Group - multiple sites, multiple brands, one head office (shared payroll)
* Franchise/managed partnerships - Owning body overseeing multiple operators with a single brand (centrally managed web team)
* Leased/Tenanted - Owning body overseeing multiple single site owner/operators
* Aggregators - web platforms representing multiple businesses/brands
* Virtual brands - food business brands which customers only order from online but are operated from an existing food business (same team, kitchen and management, but a different, online only, menu)
* Dark kitchens, also known as virtual kitchens, cloud kitchens, ghost kitchens or delivery-only restaurants -  these kitchens sell meals exclusively through delivery, often operating in temporary kitchens or using kitchen spaces within other businesses (for example using unused hotel kitchen spaces)
* Unregistered businesses - such as facebook marketplace seller


***

Internally at the Food Standards Agency, there are a number of teams which would need to work together to deliver a cohesive service. These include (but aren't limited to):
* Policy team
* Register a Food Business
* Data/Tech 
* Marketing
* Brand
* Website 

Local Authorities
* Environmental Health Officers

## Consumers

There are a range of consumer types as identified in the Fluxx Report with varying levels of interest in both food and food hygiene:

* Cautious Connoisseur
“It should be mandatory over here. I feel like every restaurant over here should have it up”

* Cheery Chancer
“I’ve ordered from places that I have no idea what the hygiene is like or what the kitchen is like”

* Moderately Mindful
”I’ll won’t take a chance with my family. I don’t want to be dealing with sick kids for days”

* Disinterested Diner
“I wouldn’t worry about it. I’ve been there before so I know what the place is like”
